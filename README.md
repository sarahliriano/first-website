## My first Website ever
I know absolutely nothing about developing websites or applications. Many if not all of the concepts and terms are new to me so I started by reading the guides and trying to understand the concepts.
I struggled a lot with the setup of the website and tried to troubleshoot as I made changes to it. As I was deciding what my website could be about I thought it would be a good idea to make it about the things that confuse me on my life journey. I imagine it could be a compilation of images and questions that befuddle me. Some could be related to ITP and others to general and personal life.

Ideally I would really like to be able to make a feed that could be live where I send images and questions from my phone and have it update the site automatically. This might be a little ambitious on my part as I have no idea how to even begin that but I would very much like to learn how.

Right now, what I've been trying to do is come up with a structure and experiment with different looks. I've been experimenting with what I can do on CSS with simple elements.
